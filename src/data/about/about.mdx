## 🎸 Hobbies

Outside of programming, I enjoy snowboarding during the winter, listening to music (you can view my most listened to albums [here](https://www.eliasf.dev/albums)), playing on my guitar, and watching good TV shows. I am passionate about everything related to technology, but I am also equally passionate about living life to the fullest!
